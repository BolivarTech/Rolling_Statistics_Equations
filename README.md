# Rolling Statistics Equations

This project provides implementations of rolling statistics equations, including the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and Rolling Standard Deviation, using Python. It is designed for analyzing time-series data and calculating statistical metrics efficiently.

## Features

- Calculate Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for time-series data.
- Compute Rolling Standard Deviation for dynamic datasets.
- Symbolic representation of equations using `sympy`.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BolivarTech/Rolling_Statistics_Equations.git
   ```
   
2. Show the equations:
   
   Open file [Rolling_Statistics.ipynb](./Rolling_Statistics.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible IDE to view the equations and their symbolic representations.
